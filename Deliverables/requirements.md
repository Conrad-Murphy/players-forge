## 1. Positioning 
**1.1. Problem Statement**

The problem of searching for and downloading game mods affects people who

the impact of which is spending extensive time on different websites to download

For people that would rather find and download mods from a single and easily accessible website,
PlayersForge is a modding collection that allows users of various gaming experiences to

to extensive modding experiences to find and download mods that match their game 
preferences inside of a simple, convenient, and eye-appealing design.
