## 1. Positioning 
**1.1. Problem Statement**

The problem of searching for and downloading game mods affects people who
don't have the time, patience, or experience with technology and mods;
the impact of which is spending extensive time on different websites to download
new mods or update ones that are already in their use.

**1.2. Product Positioning Statement** 

For people that would rather find and download mods from a single and easily accessible website,
PlayersForge is a modding collection that allows users of various gaming experiences to 
search for mods that match the games that they play in one space. Unlike GameBanana, our product
combines clean, organized, and attractive design with game mod searching.

**1.3. Value Proposition and consumer segment.**


PlayersForge is a game mod search website that allows gamers and modders with limited 
to extensive modding experiences to find and download mods that match their game 
preferences inside of a simple, convenient, and eye-appealing design.


## 2. Stakeholders

- Users: Users will include gamers and modders alike. They will be the ones who will upload and download the mods from our website.
- Developers: Developers are the ones responsible for the creation of the website.
- Communities: The ones who will be looking at our website for the potential to share and download mods for a 	specific game. 

## 3. Functional Requirements (features)

## 4. Non Functional Requirements
	1. Usability - 4 out of 5 testers should be able to navigate the service effectively.
	2. Speed - The web server should respond to and return requests within 5 seconds 95% of the time.
	3. Security - The service should be HTTPS compliant.
	4. Security - The service should scan uploaded files for suspicious code.
	5. Accessibility - The service should include alternate themes such as a dark theme and colorblind theme.
	6. Performance - Verify a score of B or better from each category on [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org)
	7. Readability - The source code of the service should be easy to understand and maintain.
	8. Resource Constraints - Besides downloads and uploads, individual pages should not exceed 10 MB.
	
## 5. MVP (Minimal Viable Product)

	The MVP for our project will be the website itself. The features we are going to validate are the ability to upload and download mods. The ability to create an account will also be required to upload mods. We will validate the features by using the website for ourselves by putting us in User role which is making sure we can create an account then seeing if we can download and upload mods. The site doesnâ€™t have to have all of the aesthetic features yet but must be functional.
