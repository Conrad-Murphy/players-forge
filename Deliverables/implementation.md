# D.4 - Implementation

Group 08 - PlayersForge\
Group Members: Kylie Cook, Fernando Diaz, David Hermann, Jared McNeece, Conrad Murphy, Noah Olono

## 1. Introduction

### Paragraph description:
PlayersForge, a system dedicated to bringing mods to gamers. From classic, to new games PlayersForgeis a system where you can find your favorite mods. Older games, as well as games not supported by the SteamWorkshop have support in our system.

### Value Proposition:
Time is precious, instead of spending hours finding mods for your favorite games. PlayersForge is the place to find mods for your favorite games. Rather than spending hours searching for mods, those hours can better be spent playing them on your system.

## 3. Adopted Technologies
Our website is currently a simple minimum viable product made with only HTML and CSS. We plan to implement a database written in Python that holds the mods, games for which those mods are made, user profiles, etc. Python is a language that we all have experience with using and is one that should be easy to learn and write.

## 4. Learning / Training
The primary learning stategy employed by our team has been dividing the research and distributing it to group members in equal amounts and based off their interests. 
With some of us having a previous foundation with web programming and development, we decided it would be best to implement the use of paired programming over screen-share to allow less experienced members to gain an understanding, while also maintaining a standardized style of code. Along with the strategy of "divide and conquer", we also have made use of meeting online during the week to establish progression/ how on track we are to meet that weeks deadline; consolidating larger tasks for the entire 
group to work on together. 

Through the use of both Discord and Trello, we've been able to report back and educated the rest of the group on what our findings are. We've also created several designated channels for specific parts of the project, including: a team-member made tutorial for setting up Github desktop, important documents/links, as well as a general chat with important weekly information pinned.

## 8. Look & Feel
The website was made with the desire to make it look pleasant, unlike many gamer oriented websites that overdo it with the color pallates. Our website was made with simplicity in mind, and to make the experience of finding your favorite mod as easy as possible. We did not want to implement the obnoxious neon color, and overcomplicated search menus.

## 9. Lessons Learned
We learned how to work as a team to contribute to code, even while we are all separated by distance. We also learned how to set up an AWS server and how to use GitHub to organize our development and integrate licensing. For our next release, we plan to incorporate back-end code for our database.
