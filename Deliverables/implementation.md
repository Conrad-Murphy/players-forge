## 1. Introduction
### Paragraph description:
PlayersForge, a system dedicated to bringing mods to gamers. From classic, to new games PlayersForge is a system where you can find your favorite mods. Older games, as well as games not supported by the SteamWorkshop have support in our system.

### Value Proposition:
Time is precious, instead of spending hours finding mods for your favorite games. PlayersForge is the place to find mods for your favorite games. Rather than spending hours searching for mods, those hours can better be spent playing them on your system.

## 2. Implemented Requirements

## 3. Adopted Technologies
Our website is currently simply a minimum viable product made with only HTML and CSS. We plan to implement a database written in Python that holds the mods, games for which those mods are made, user profiles, etc.

## 4. Learning / Training
The primary learning stategy employed by our team has been dividing the research and distributing it to group members in equal amounts and based off their interests. 
With some of us having a previous foundation with web programming and development, we decided it would be best to implement the use of paired programming over screen-share to allow less experienced members to gain an understanding, while also maintaining a standardized style of code. Along with the strategy of "divide and conquer", we also have made use of meeting online during the week to establish progression/ how on track we are to meet that weeks deadline; consolidating larger tasks for the entire 
group to work on together. 

Through the use of both Discord and Trello, we've been able to report back and educated the rest of the group on what our findings are. We've also created several designated channels for specific parts of the project, including: a team-member made tutorial for setting up Github desktop, important documents/links, as well as a general chat with important weekly information pinned.

A service dedicated to providing mods to gamers. Helping users search for mods, including those which may not be supported by the steam library. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
A good computer, with a decent internet speed.
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a mod running


```
Download mod, and follow the step by step instructions provided by the mod.
```


```
until finished
```



## Running the tests

Open the game being modded, and verify that the mod has been installed.

If the mod does not appear, restart your computer and reopen the game again.

If mod is still unable to be loaded, check our Q&A section, or access our support forums.

## 8. Look & Feel

## 9. Lessons Learned
We learned that we can make a nice front-end design for a website using simple knowledge of HTML and CSS. For our next release, we must incorporate some back-end code for our database.
