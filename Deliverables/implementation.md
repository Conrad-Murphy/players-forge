## 2. Implemented Requirements

## 3. Adopted Technologies
Our website is currently simply a minimum viable product made with only HTML and CSS. We plan to implement a database written in Python that holds the mods, games for which those mods are made, user profiles, etc.

## 4. Learning / Training
The primary learning stategy employed by our team has been dividing the research and distributing it to group members in equal amounts and based off their interests. 
With some of us having a previous foundation with web programming and development, we decided it would be best to implement the use of paired programming over screen-share to allow less experienced members to gain an understanding, while also maintaining a standardized style of code. Along with the strategy of "divide and conquer", we also have made use of meeting online during the week to establish progression/ how on track we are to meet that weeks deadline; consolidating larger tasks for the entire 
group to work on together. 

Through the use of both Discord and Trello, we've been able to report back and educated the rest of the group on what our findings are. We've also created several designated channels for specific parts of the project, including: a team-member made tutorial for setting up Github desktop, important documents/links, as well as a general chat with important weekly information pinned. 

## 5. Deployment

## 6. Licensing

## 7. Readme File

## 8. Look & Feel

## 9. Lessons Learned
We learned that we can make a nice front-end design for a website using simple knowledge of HTML and CSS. For our next release, we must incorporate some back-end code for our database.
