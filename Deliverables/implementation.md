# D.4 - Implementation

Group 08 - PlayersForge\
Group Members: Kylie Cook, Fernando Diaz, David Hermann, Jared McNeece, Conrad Murphy, Noah Olono

## 1. Introduction

### Paragraph description:
PlayersForge, a system dedicated to bringing mods to gamers. From classic, to new games PlayersForgeis a system where you can find your favorite mods. Older games, as well as games not supported by the SteamWorkshop have support in our system.

### Value Proposition:
Time is precious, instead of spending hours finding mods for your favorite games. PlayersForge is the place to find mods for your favorite games. Rather than spending hours searching for mods, those hours can better be spent playing them on your system.

### Description of the main features of the software:

- [Github](https://github.com/KylieNCook/players-forge)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/cs3864)

## 2. Implemented Requirements

### Implemented/Prototyped Use Cases
- Search for mods
- Download mods

### Implemented/Prototyped User Stories
- As a PlayersForge user I want to have a modular layout that allows me to customize my home page
	so that it looks as I want it to.
- As a PlayersForge user I would like to have a dedicated part of my library that shows my favorite
	mods, so I can access them quickly.

### Implemented/Prototyped Features
- Allow users to download published mods for free without an account.
- Allow users to search for mods based on key words and categories and receive results sorted by
	relevance and popularity.
- Allow users to create an account and become a registered member.



List in this section, the requirements (user stories, issues, or use cases) that you
implemented for this release. We expect that you implement/prototype features you
specified in your MVP (c.f. D.2 Requirements). Include who worked on each of the
features.

## 3. Adopted Technologies

Our website is currently simply a minimum viable product made with only HTML and CSS. We plan to implement a database written in Python that holds the mods, games for which those mods are made, user profiles, etc.

## 4. Learning / Training
The primary learning stategy employed by our team has been dividing the research and distributing it to group members in equal amounts and based off their interests. 
With some of us having a previous foundation with web programming and development, we decided it would be best to implement the use of paired programming over screen-share to allow less experienced members to gain an understanding, while also maintaining a standardized style of code. Along with the strategy of "divide and conquer", we also have made use of meeting online during the week to establish progression/ how on track we are to meet that weeks deadline; consolidating larger tasks for the entire 
group to work on together. 

Through the use of both Discord and Trello, we've been able to report back and educated the rest of the group on what our findings are. We've also created several designated channels for specific parts of the project, including: a team-member made tutorial for setting up Github desktop, important documents/links, as well as a general chat with important weekly information pinned. 

## 5. Deployment
We are deploying our project through Amazon Web Services. By using this service we were able to get a server for our website running with a domain as well. We will be using AWS for the deployment of our website and will keep using it for the future of it as long as it remains active.

## 7. Readme File

## 8. Look & Feel
The website was made with the desire to make it look pleasant, unlike many gamer oriented websites that overdo it with the color pallates. Our website was made with simplicity in mind, and to make the experience of finding your favorite mod as easy as possible. We did not want to implement the obnoxious neon color, and overcomplicated search menus.

## 9. Lessons Learned
We learned how to work as a team to contribute to code, even while we are all separated by distance. We also learned how to set up an AWS server and how to use GitHub to organize our development and integrate licensing. For our next release, we plan to incorporate back-end code for our database.
