Group 08 – PlayersForge\
Group Members: Kylie Cook,

## 1. Introduction:

Gaming has become a global hobby that brings many people together. From competitive gaming to limitless customizability, modern games have
become diverse in content. Likewise, many communities have come together to modify their favorite games. But, such modifications or mods as
they are referred to in the gaming community are at times hard to find. PlayersForge is a service created to facilitate such issues, providing
a hub where players can more easily find mods for their favorite games, or upload their own creations. By joining our service, players will
be able to subscribe to their favorite games. Subscribing allows our system to find all the mods relevant to the game. In addition favoriting your
favorite mods will let you find similar content, updates, and store them in your library for future use. Users of the service will also be able to link
their social media accounts in order to share and promote their own mods.

### Interview 4:
**Summary:** Carson believes that a system such a PlayersForge can be useful, as long as it
features proper communication. Or features that can unite players together.  
**Interviewer:** Fernando Diaz \
**Interviewee:** Carson Posciask \
**When:** February 7, 2021\
**Consumer Segment:** Carson is a gamer, obsessed with the KFC game: I love You Colonel Sanders. As well as fps games such as Rainbow Siege Six, and Call of Duty.\
**Key Insights:**
- According to Carson, it is important to have categories to the games. Categories will make games easier to find, and will also
allow users to find different games in the same category that may appeal to them. A recommendation system can also engage users to find
new games they might like, while also giving them a list of relevant mods. 

**Representative Quotes:**
- "I believe it would be a fun game if it was interactive, such as a live chat. Or just having voice chats for players to engange 
with each other." 
- "Although I understand the name, I believe is a bit too long. The name feels like is just oriented to a single community of 
fantasy users. Almost as if the service was tailored for people who play DnD games, rather than gamers."

**Assessment: Must have:N/A / Nice to have: N/A / Don’t care:**
- Must have: 
 Easy communication or team chat. \
 Flexibity across different Operating Systems, such as Linux, Windows, or MacOs.
- Nice to have:
Live chat or voice chat, not a necessity. \
Ability to link projects to different social media and professional platforms.
- Don't care:
Game Billboards. 

### Interview 5:
**Summary:** Found lack of games supported on the steam workshop. Even games that are supported on the Steam Workshop don’t allow you to directly apply the mods to your game 
easily. Not aware of any other online modding websites such as GameBanana.
**Interviewer:** Jared McNeece \
**Interviewee:** Kolton Koltrap \
**When:** February 13, 2021\
**Consumer Segment:** PC Gamer\

**Key Insights:**
- According to Kolton, he has very little modding experience with most of it being done on the steam game Left 4 Dead 2. What he hopes for is a more simplified modding experience
  with an ease of installation. 

**Representative Quotes:**
  - "I barely know where to begin to install mods."
  - "They always hog so much storage on my hard drive"
  - "Steam doens't always have mod support with their games in the workshop."

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care:**
  - Verification that there is no embedded malicious code, or verify developers (Must Have)
  - Very easy UI/Dashboard (Must Have)
  - Log In that shows what mods they have and what updates are available (Nice To Have)
  - Have reccommendations based on what games are installed on a PC (Nice To Have)
  - Rating and reviews (Nice To Have)
  - Excessive advertising (Don't Care)

### Interview 6:

**Summary:** Rarely uses mods in video games unless they are easily implemented. Doesn’t like dealing with file explorer and having to follow archaic steps to 
install mods from external sources. Would prefer a one stop place to find and install new mods.

**Interviewer:** Jared McNeece\
**Interviewee:** Noah Harris\
**When:** February 13, 2021\
**Consumer Segment:** PC Gamer\

**Key Insights:**
  - Noah has a pretty expansive experience with modding, with almost all of it being on the steam workshop with games such as Skyrim and Left 4 Dead 2. As issue he has with the experience
    is that installed mods are not indentifiable inside the file explorer; they are downloaded with a string of numbers for their filename

**Representative Quotes:**
  - "Simpler mod storage process"
  - "Clear and concise file naming for mods"
  - "Mods should be able to be sorted by popularity/ most downloads."

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care:**
