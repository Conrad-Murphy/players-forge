Group Members: Kylie Cook,

## 1. Introduction:

Gaming is a world-wide hobby that brings billions of people together with competition and unlimited creation. With the ability to modify games in a way that a user enjoys, it tends to be difficult and time-consuming to search for these game-adjusting packages. With PlayersForge, a website created for gamers that wish to find mods with ease, users can download, upload, and favorite mods of their liking. Gamers will be able to subscribe to games in order to see the mods that will interest them most. Within profiles, users can link their social media accounts and provide self-made mods for others to use. Mods will be easily found through favoriting, where users can download an updated version of a mod, or keep a mod close by for future use.
